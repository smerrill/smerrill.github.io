# About this Site

My name is Steven Merrill. I'm a classical singer and technologist based in New York, NY.

This site is my personal blog. My [initial post](blog/steven/2009/01/24/back-blogging/) lays out this site's scope and also the etymology of the name, in case you're interested.

### Around the Web

You can find my work a number of other places on the web:

- I write technical articles on [Phase2's blog](http://www.phase2technology.com/author/smerrill/).
- [Brian McMurray](http://www.brianmcmurray.com/) and I wrote web development articles (often about Drupal, Flash, and the mobile web) [at cascadingStyle](http://cascadingstyle.net/).
- I put up a personal portfolio in mid-2008, but it hasn't been updated recently.
- My singing portfolio was a great proof-of-concept of a Drupal-driven Flash site with full Google-indexable content underneath, but has similarly been somewhat neglected.
- I microblog on Twitter as [stevenmerrill](https://twitter.com/stevenmerrill).
- Many of my open source contributions can be found [on my 'smerrill' GitHub account](https://github.com/smerrill).

Thanks for stopping by!
