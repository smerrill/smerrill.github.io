<p>This weekend marked the second annual <a href="http://www.drupalcampnj.org/" target="_">DrupalCamp New Jersey</a> at beautiful Princeton University.</p></p>
<p>I was happy to fill in when a presenter dropped out and presented a session called "Testing Drupal with Ghosts and Gherkins". In this presentation, I talked about how both CasperJS or Behat could be brought to bear to test a Drupal application and gave some demos of each. The slides are embedded below.</p></p>

</p>
<p>Here are some links to the items demoed in the presentation so that you can give them a shot on your own sites.</p></p>
<p>Information about CasperJS is available at its website, <a href="http://casperjs.org/">casperjs.org</a>. You can read more about CasperJS's parent project, PhantomJS, at <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">phantomjs.org</a>.</p></p>
<p>The sample CasperJS scripts adapted from our Testing with Friendly Ghosts presentation are available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/ericduran/friendly-ghosts-examples">github.com/ericduran/friendly-ghosts-examples</a>.</p></p>
<p>Similarly, documentation for both Behat and the Mink browser-testing extension is available at <a href="http://behat.org/">behat.org</a>. </p></p>
<p>If you'd like to try out a sample project that uses Behat and Mink and one custom Mink step definition to test some sample assertions on the Phase2 website, it's on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/phase2/behat-phase2tech/">github.com/phase2/behat-phase2tech/</a>.</p></p>
<p>Finally, our set of Drupal-based Behat and Mink step definitions are released as Open Source on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/phase2/behat-drupal-extension">github.com/phase2/behat-drupal-extension</a>.</p></p>
