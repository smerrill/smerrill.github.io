<h3>Drupal 5 / Views 1 Execution</h3></p>
<p>Views 1 for Drupal 5 also has this mechanism in place, so if you're working on a Drupal 5 site, it's still worth using. It&rsquo;s how the calendar and date modules provide a default calendar view, among other things.  The method for putting default views in your modules is pretty similar, and it&rsquo;s still a great technique to practice.  In Views 2 for Drupal 6, you had to implement two hooks to have a module provide default views in code: hook_views_api() and hook_views_default_views().</p></p>
<p>Views 1 doesn&rsquo;t have the hook_views_api(), nor will Views 1 automatically look for a MODULENAME.views.inc or a MODULENAME.views_default.inc file, so you can just put an implementation of hook_views_default_views() in your main module file.  If we were making the fictitious treehouse_utils module, the code would look exactly the same as in the previous example:</p></p>
<p>
<div class="geshifilter">
<div class="php geshifilter-php"><span class="sy0">&</span>lt<span class="sy0">;</span>?php<br /><br />
<span class="kw2">function</span> treehouse_utils_views_default_views<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span> <span class="br0">{</span><br /><br />
<span class="re0">$views</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> <a href="http://www.php.net/array"><span class="kw3">array</span></a><span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy0">;</span><br /><br />
<br /><br />
<span class="co1">// Start copy and paste of Export tab output.</span><br /><br />
<br /><br />
<span class="co1">// End copy and paste of Export tab output.</span><br /><br />
<br /><br />
<span class="co1">// Add view to list of views to provide.</span><br /><br />
<span class="re0">$views</span><span class="br0">[</span><span class="re0">$view</span><span class="sy0">-&</span>gt<span class="sy0">;</span>name<span class="br0">]</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="re0">$view</span><span class="sy0">;</span><br /><br />
<br /><br />
<span class="co1">// ...Repeat all of the above for each view the module should provide.</span><br /><br />
<br /><br />
<span class="co1">// At the end, return array of default views.</span><br /><br />
<span class="kw1">return</span> <span class="re0">$views</span><span class="sy0">;</span><br /><br />
<span class="br0">}</span></div></div></p></p>
<h3>Activating Your Views</h3></p>
<p>Unlike Views2, default views are updated when a module is first enabled, so if you are adding default views to an existing module, you will have to disable and re-enable the module to get them to show up, or clear out the Views cache, which you can do by going to <a href="http://yoursite.com/admin/build/views/tools" title="http://yoursite.com/admin/build/views/tools">http://yoursite.com/admin/build/views/tools</a> and clicking the Clear Views Cache button.</p></p>
<p>The Clear Views Cache approach is a far cleaner one than disabling and reenabling modules. I recently put some default views for Drupal 5 in a custom module which was the backbone of our site, and disabling and re-enabling it was no easy task.</p></p>
